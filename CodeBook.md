##Data transformations performed

run_analysis.R performs does the following to produce a final tiday dataset:

* read in the training, test datasets and support tables from file
* bind the activity and subject ids to each table using y_ and subject_ support files
* replace the column names with better descriptions in features.txt
* subset the mean and std (standard deviation) from the training and test data tables
* merge the test and training datasets
* add column with better activity names from activity_lables file
* melt the dataset using ActivityID, ActivityName and SubjectID as id variables
* cast the melted dataset to take the mean of measured variables
* output the cleaned up file to tidydata.txt in the current directory

##Raw data description

The data was collected by subjects wearing a Samsung cell phone while performing each of 4 actions.

The raw data were collected from the cell phone's accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
The mean and std were used for analysis in this script.
